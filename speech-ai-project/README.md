# Speech AI Project

This project implements a Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech model using deep learning techniques. The goal is to provide a robust solution for converting spoken language into written text and vice versa.

## Overview

The Speech AI Project consists of two main components:
1. **Speech to Text**: A model that processes audio input and generates corresponding text output.
2. **Text to Speech**: A model that converts text input into audio output.
